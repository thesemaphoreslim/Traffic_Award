# Traffic_Award

Designed to award and incentivize Burst transactions across the network, the Traffic_Award program utilizes a client's updated node (blockchain) to query for transactions in a given timeframe and add qualifying sender addresses to a raffle. Winners are drawn from a list at random and displayed in the console window.

This application is written in .NET Core.
